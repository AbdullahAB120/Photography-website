<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a Photography website template. When I have completed SASS after HTML, CSS & Bootstarp, I made this website for practise purpose. I made this website with HTML, CSS, Bootstarp &SASS. So this is fully responsive website. Also it is a static website, not a dynamic website. But it is a creative work for me. Because this website's GUI was totally my own idea. However, you can contact with me for more information. Thank you for visiting my github repo...!
